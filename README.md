# ZenMind

## Project Overview
ZenMind is a comprehensive wellness app designed to help university students manage stress and improve their overall health through personalized recommendations on sleep, hydration, and meditation. Developed by Team Zen, this app aims to foster healthy habits, optimize productivity, and prevent burnout by offering tailored advice based on individual user habits.

## Motivation
University life can be overwhelmingly stressful, often leading to the development of poor health habits among students. Recognizing the pivotal role of sleep, hydration, and meditation in enhancing cognitive function and reducing anxiety, ZenMind seeks to provide a holistic solution to support students in maintaining a healthy lifestyle amidst their busy schedules.

## Features
- **Personalized Hydration Recommendations:** Based on user input such as height, weight, and exercise routine, ZenMind suggests daily water intake goals.
- **Meditation and Stress Management:** Offers meditation exercises and uses heart rate data from connected smartwatches to recommend stress-relief practices.
- **Sleep Optimization:** Users can track and set sleep and wake times, receiving recommendations for optimal sleep based on their patterns.
- **Lifestyle Score and Recommendations:** Generates reports on the user's adherence to a healthy lifestyle, offering insights and future suggestions.
- **Community Support:** Although not fully implemented, future updates aim to include peer-to-peer connections to foster a support network among users.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository from our GitHub link.
2. Ensure you have Android Studio installed.
3. Open the project in Android Studio and wait for the Gradle build to finish.
4. Connect an Android device or use the emulator to run the app.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your user profile and start using ZenMind.

## Usage
- **Getting Started:** Upon launching ZenMind, users are prompted to enter basic information critical for customizing recommendations.
- **Tracking and Recommendations:** Users manually input data such as water intake, sleep hours, and meditation practices. ZenMind analyzes this data to provide personalized health recommendations.
- **Weekly Reports:** Users receive summaries of their health and wellness activities along with suggestions for improvement (future feature).

## Challenges and Roadblocks
- Integrating multiple recommendation systems into a unified app experience.
- Handling version control issues across different operating systems within the team.
- Attempting to integrate wearable API for automated data collection, which proved challenging due to the team's inexperience with Firebase and API data handling.

## Future Work
- **Wearable API Integration:** Automate data collection for enhanced accuracy and user convenience.
- **Community Building Features:** Implement peer-to-peer support functionalities.
- **Email Service:** Develop a system for sending personalized email reports to users, summarizing their weekly progress and recommendations.
